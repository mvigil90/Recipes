\textit{Notes: This recipe is from Jill Winger at \url{http://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2012/07/simple-no-cook-vanilla-ice-cream.html}
\\
While it is good with any dairy, we have found that using ultra-pasteurized dairy causes the milk fat to separate more significantly, giving the ice cream a less integrated texture upon initial serving and causing it to be more icy in subsequent servings. If possible, use organic milk and cream that are minimally processed for a smoother texture.
\\
This is an American- or Philidelphia-style ice cream, meaning it requires no cooking or eggs. While the texture is less smooth than a custard-based (or French-style) ice cream, I think the flavor is brighter and fresher.
